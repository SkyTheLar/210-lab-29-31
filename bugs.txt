(fixed during alpha relase)
The statement "if (it != cafe.end())" in the drinks made
part of the time cycle function was meant to check if the
ordered list is empty before attempting to move an item from
the ordered list to the made list. This if statement wasn't
properly checking that and I would get range errors on about
50% of runs. I replaced the statement with 
"if (it->second[0].begin() != it->second[0].end())"

(fixed during alpha relase)
In the drinks ordered part of the time cycle function the 
if-else statement that determined how many drinks to move
caused errors because it was checking the the length of 
the ordered list ("if (it->second[2].size() >= MAX_SV)")
instead of the made list. I fixed this by changing the index
to point to the right list. "if (it->second[1].size() >= MAX_SV)"
