(fixed during alpha relase)
The statement "if (it != cafe.end())" in the drinks made
part of the time cycle function was meant to check if the
ordered list is empty before attempting to move an item from
the ordered list to the made list. This if statement wasn't
properly checking that and I would get range errors on about
50% of runs. I replaced the statement with 
"if (it->second[0].begin() != it->second[0].end())"

(fixed during alpha relase)
In the drinks ordered part of the time cycle function the 
if-else statement that determined how many drinks to move
caused errors because it was checking the the length of 
the ordered list ("if (it->second[2].size() >= MAX_SV)")
instead of the made list. I fixed this by changing the index
to point to the right list. "if (it->second[1].size() >= MAX_SV)"

When I first changed the alpha input files to the actual input
files the program would terminate. I realized this was because
the constants no longer matched with how many file entries there
were and changed the constants to fix the problem.

The console was being filled with lines for drinks being made
when no one was getting those drinks made for them. I fixed this
by making the output conditional on the ordered list not being
empty. I added the same thing for the served list depending on the
made list.

Fixing the above bug caused blank lines to show since the line breaks
were at a seperate point of the text. I couldn't add the same conditional
to the line breaks since it was after the list was modified so istead I 
just made the entire list editing chunk conditional on the list not being
empty. Again I did the same thing for the served chunk.

6:
The commas spacing the names in the made and served statements cause
a comma on the end of a line where there shouldn't be one. Because the other
displays don't have any kind of commas I just removed these and replaced them
with spaces which wouldn't cause any end of line issues.
