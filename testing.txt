To test the random getName function, a driver program will
run a loop populating an array with the function outputs while
running the function on a two item array. The program will
	1: confirm that the array is full
	2: confirm that the probability of a given name 
	   is close to 50%
	   
To test the timeCycle function a driver program will run
the function, saving the theoretical values of each list
in a parallel array. After the function is run the lists
be compared to the array to make sure they match. The funciton
will be run and tested 10 times.
